## About

This game is project to create a 2D tiled game from scratch. I'm working alone on this project next to my studies, so do not expect a lot of activities.

---
## Download

You can find the source code on [Github](https://github.com/ShadowoftheRedFox/Kyrazail-Adventure-Dev), and you can dowload the game on [itch.io](https://shadowoftheredfox.itch.io/kyrazail-adventure). The game is also available to play online on the same page on itch.io. 
The game is not available on IOS because the NWjs Builder library does not work with me for this platform.

## Update and Uninstallation

### Update
For the moment, you need to update your game manually if you downloaded it. I will try to create an auto updater, but it may come at different times depending your platform.

### Uninstallation
You just need to delete the [game folder](./). And you're done!

### Tips

Oh, you read until here? You really like reading README files, don't you? *Cough*

Anyway, here are some tips to help you in the game:
- The more expensive item is not always the best! Look for the one that suit your character the most.
- It's okay to retreat in a battle. You won't win or lose anything.
- Farming mobs is a good idea. You get Dinarks, loots and experiences.
- Are you sure you can take this boss? Save your game before doing anything stupid.
- The map is pretty bug, do you think some treasures are hidden? Heck yeah!
- You don't understand a quest? Maybe the help in the pause menu will unstuck you.
